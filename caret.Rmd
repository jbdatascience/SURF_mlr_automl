The caret package (short for _C_lassification _A_nd _RE_gression _T_raining).

There is a [book Applied Predictive Modelling](http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781461468486), a [paper](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v028i05) and a [Datacamp training](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/machine-learning-toolbox) based on the package to learn how to use it.

Focused on less steps of the processing pipeline:

- data splitting
- pre-processing
- feature selection
- model tuning using resampling
- variable importance estimation



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
